        "\n",
        "1. Nominal Data: This type of qualitative data represents categories without any inherent order. The categories are distinct and can be named, but they cannot be ranked. For example, types of fruit (like apples, bananas, and oranges) or colors (like red, blue, and green) are nominal data. Each category is separate and does not imply any ranking.\n",

        "2. Ordinal Data: Ordinal data also consists of categories, but in this case, the categories have a meaningful order or ranking. However, the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal. An example of ordinal data could be survey responses like \"satisfied,\" \"neutral,\" and \"dissatisfied.\" Here, we can rank the responses, but we cannot quantify the difference between them.\n",

        "On the other hand, quantitative data is numerical and can be measured or counted. This type of data can be further divided into interval and ratio scales.\n",

        "1. Interval Data: Interval data is numerical data where the intervals between values are meaningful and consistent, but there is no true zero point. A common example is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. For instance, the difference between 10°C and 20°C is the same as between 20°C and 30°C, but 0°C does not represent the absence of temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Ratio Data: Ratio data is similar to interval data, but it has a true zero point, allowing for the comparison of absolute magnitudes. Examples of ratio data include height, weight, and age. For instance, if someone weighs 0 kg, it means there is no weight, and we can say that a person weighing 80 kg is twice as heavy as a person weighing 40 kg."

        "\n",
        "1. Mean: The mean is the average of a set of values, calculated by adding all the numbers together and dividing by the count of values. It is useful for datasets without extreme values (outliers) because outliers can skew the mean significantly.\n",

        "2. Median: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The median is particularly useful for skewed distributions or when there are outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values.\n",

For example, the number of students in a classroom or the number of cars that pass through a toll booth in an hour are discrete random variables.
